	[Madeline right sad]
		What happened?

	[Theo left normal]
		I'm not sure. 
		I vaguely remember an earthquake, or something...
		Next thing I know, I'm trapped in this thing.

	[Madeline right normal]
		I'm so glad to see you.
	[Madeline right sadder]
		I thought you hated me...

	[Theo left serious]
		Sorry about that.
	[Theo left thinking]
		This was supposed to be a quick day trip.
		I thought I could use another adventure.
	[Theo left normal]
		Turns out, not my best idea.
	[Theo left thinking]
		Speaking of which...
		As much as I'd love to catch up, could you, uh...

	[Madeline right distracted]
		Oh, right.

		Let's get you out of there.

	[Theo left worried]
		Me?
	[Theo left wtf]
		What did {~}you{/~} do to it?

	[Madeline right sad]
		Nothing...
	[Madeline right distracted]
		I think...

	[Theo left thinking]
		Maybe it just wanted to be left alone.
		Which is perfectly fine with me.
		I'm never going back.

	[Madeline right sad]
		I agree.
	[Madeline right distracted]
		That mountain was {~}way{/~} too pointy.

	[Theo left wtf]
		Pointy?

	[Madeline right distracted]

	[Madeline right normal]
		Pointy Mountain!

	[Theo left wtf]
		{0.3}...{0.3}
		You do realize it has an {~}actual{/~} name, right?
	[Theo left thinking]
		This must be the oxygen deprivation talking.
		We better get you to the base quick.

		{0.3}...{0.3}
		I'm perfectly fine.
	[Madeline right sad]
		Just... tired.
	[Madeline right upset]
		From saving {~}you{/~}.
		Again.

	[Theo left normal]
		Right... thanks for that.
		Mostly, anyway.

	[Theo left thinking]
		In case you haven't noticed, I'm still stuck in this thing.
		And I don't know where to find another giant eyeball.

	[Madeline right sad]
		Oh, don't worry about that.
	[Madeline right normal]
		I've got a chainsaw at home.

	[Theo left wtf]
